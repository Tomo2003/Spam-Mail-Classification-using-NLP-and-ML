# Spam Mail Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

This project aims to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques.
- Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
- Spam classification using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Random Forest.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK/Spacy
- Pandas and NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
